#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1.Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry
Software engineering is a branch of computer science focused on designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications. Software engineering aims to create reliable, efficient, and scalable software to meet user and business needs.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
i. Waterfall: This is a sequential approach with distinct phrases flowing down wards like a waterfall
ii. Agile: Interactive and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboartion and responding to agile framework emphasizing small self organizational change
iii. Scrum: Teams working in short iteractions called sprints.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 1. Planning – Estimating costs, resources, and feasibility.
 2. Requirement Analysis – Defining user and business needs. 
 3. Design – Defining the software architecture, system components, data flow, and user interface to ensure a structured foundation 
 4. Implementation – Writing and developing the code.
 5. Testing – Identifying and fixing defects through unit, integration, and system testing to ensure functionality, performance, and security.
 6. Deployment – Releasing the software to users.
 7. Maintenance – Providing updates and support

    
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a linear, step-by-step approach, ideal for stable projects like government or financial systems, while Agile is iterative and flexible, suited for evolving projects like mobile apps.

Key Differences:

Flexibility: 
Waterfall is rigid, while Agile adapts to change.
Delivery:
Waterfall delivers at the end, while Agile delivers in sprints.
Feedback:
Waterfall has minimal feedback, while Agile involves continuous input

Waterfall is used for Large, well-defined projects.
Agile is used for dynamic projects needing frequent updates.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.  Software Developer – Develops, tests, and maintains software, ensuring functionality and efficiency while collaborating on features and bug fixes.
2.  Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer – Ensures software quality through testing, identifying bugs, automating tests, and verifying security and compliance
3.  Project Manager – Plans and oversees project timelines, coordinates teams, manages risks, and ensures project goals align with stakeholder expectations.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) improve productivity with features like code completion, debugging, and syntax highlighting. Examples include Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and Eclipse, providing an all-in-one development workspace.

Version Control Systems (VCS) track code changes, enable collaboration, and prevent data loss. Tools like Git, SVN, and Mercurial, along with platforms like GitHub and GitLab, streamline development and teamwork.

Both IDEs and VCS enhance efficiency, reduce errors, and ensure high-quality software.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software engineers often face challenges like the following:

1.  Keeping Up with Technology – Rapid changes require continuous learning.
Solution: Follow tech blogs, take online courses, and attend industry events.

2. Debugging & Bug Fixing – Identifying issues can be time-consuming.
Solution: Use debugging tools, write clean code, and perform thorough testing.

3.  Meeting Deadlines – Tight schedules can cause stress and errors.
Solution: Use Agile methods, prioritize tasks, and set realistic goals.

4.  Communication Gaps – Poor collaboration can delay projects.
Solution: Use project management tools (e.g., Jira, Trello) and maintain clear documentation.

5.  Security & Performance Issues – Vulnerabilities impact reliability.
Solution: Follow security best practices, conduct code reviews, and optimize performance.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
 Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
 System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 
- Whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 Prompt engineering involves crafting effective prompts to optimize AI interactions, ensuring accurate and relevant responses.
Importance:
Improves AI Accuracy – Well-structured prompts yield precise answers.
Boosts Efficiency – Reduces trial and error, saving time.
Customizes AI Output – Tailors responses for specific needs like coding or content creation.
Enhances AI Utility – Enables better automation and decision-making. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about technology."

Improved Prompt:
"Explain AI's impact on healthcare, including benefits and challenges."

The improved prompt is more effective because it is;
1.  More specific – Focuses on AI in healthcare.
2.  Clearer scope – Asks for both benefits and challenges.
3.  Concise and direct – Ensures a relevant, insightful response.


Draw a picture of a person- (Vagued Prompt)
Draw a full-body portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a red jacket and blue jeans, standing in a park on a sunny day with trees and grass in the background.
Clarity: The improved prompt specifies what is being asked (a full-body portrait) rather than just a "person.
Specific Details: Describing the woman's appearance (long brown hair, red jacket, blue jeans) and the setting (park, sunny day, trees, grass) gives clear guidance on the image to be created.
Concise: The additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the artist to understand exactly what is needed.
